Some comments on my implementation: 
1) It is straightforward; it directly follows the pseudo-code in the attached article. 
2) The model itself does not include a predictive system. It just represents an inclusion of the graph into the Euclidean space. 
3) The hyperparameters used in my implementation are taken directly from the article.
